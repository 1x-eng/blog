Tough and wrong to generalize, but LinkedIn bios are seldom a joke. Having worked with quite a few over the last 16-17 years, some are absolutely terrible at tech, people skills, or most often both. But their LinkedIn profiles - oh my wow! On the contrary, those who are past the Dunning-Kruger curve have far less &amp;lsquo;shiny&amp;rsquo; LinkedIn bios, but these are people who can get things done.</description></item><item><title>Barrier: The Underdog Triumph in a Proprietary World</title><link>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/battling-the-multiscreen-barrier/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 16:47:41 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/battling-the-multiscreen-barrier/</guid><description>Multi-Screen Setups: battle stations, afterall. Right? :wink: I&amp;rsquo;m all about multi-monitor setups – and I&amp;rsquo;m talking way beyond just a couple of screens. :grin: Sure, I&amp;rsquo;ve had my share of neck strains from less than ideal arrangements, but that&amp;rsquo;s part of the fun, right? Experimenting until everything clicks. My current pride and joy? A setup with two ultrawide monitors, a slim ultrawide, and my laptop&amp;rsquo;s screen. Yep, that&amp;rsquo;s four screens in total.</description></item><item><title>People the Problem</title><link>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/people-the-problem/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 08:53:12 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/people-the-problem/</guid><description>Smart-ass complex, not giving a shit &amp;amp; incompetence There&amp;rsquo;s no short of snarky, condescending tech articles out there, sometimes they are pure BS but often they are an attempt to paint the &amp;ldquo;picture&amp;rdquo; in black and white by some frustrated programmer. Stumbled upon Dimitry&amp;rsquo;s take - incompetent people are the problem, while we are strangers, his words struck a chord.
I resonate with these bits from Dimitry&amp;rsquo;s article &amp;amp; PS: all views are my own.</description></item><item><title>Point estimations and Sprints, huh</title><link>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/whats-with-points/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 17:47:42 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/whats-with-points/</guid><description>Yet another post about software estimations - shouldn&amp;rsquo;t it either be 1 point or NFI (No **** Idea) There are things that engineers - especially software folk do well, we nail some really hard intangible problems on its head and boy, it feels good to build something ground up or cleanup a pile of mess. But, this group, almost holistically suck at one thing - that is estimation.
Software engineers are notoriously poor estimators (well, its my blog so this is my view anyways).</description></item><item><title>Database Is Sacred</title><link>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/database-is-sacred/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2023 20:07:09 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/database-is-sacred/</guid><description>Database is Sacred: An &amp;ldquo;Engineer&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; Testament What does the word &amp;lsquo;database&amp;rsquo; make you think of? It&amp;rsquo;s probably difficult to generalize, but I&amp;rsquo;m guessing a good chunk of you would think of a &amp;lsquo;relational&amp;rsquo; flavor. Well, there&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of &amp;lsquo;flavors&amp;rsquo; among databases today, and I feel like talking — or venting — about how often relational databases are used beneath their potential today
(Relational) Databases are awesome My (not so distant) future self will probably negate this title😁, but for the purpose of this blog or the context in my head today, yes - relational databases are awesome.</description></item><item><title>We Have a Problem</title><link>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/we-have-a-problem/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2022 17:40:27 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/we-have-a-problem/</guid><description>The Reality of Imaginary Problems - In the context of Software Many factors lead to ineffective software development: from the tools used, to team communication, to the personal motivation of developers, the testing approach to the organisational leadership matrix. Among these, there&amp;rsquo;s a fundamental issue that often results in poorly conceived software: chasing perceived or, more often than not, non-existent problems, that take shape through the process to prove some kinda relevance by one or many involved directly or indirectly in the process.</description></item><item><title>Pipelines</title><link>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/pipelines/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 10:42:18 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/pipelines/</guid><description>Serverless Data Pipelines: AWS Glue is a potential future poster figure; maybe not just yet! Data engineering plays a pivotal role in the success of organizations, especially those that are data-driven. It can make or break an organization&amp;rsquo;s growth. Data pipelines form the foundation of data engineering. However, the term &amp;ldquo;pipeline&amp;rdquo; has become somewhat clichéd in software engineering, as it can mean different things depending on the context and significance of the tasks involved.</description></item><item><title>Logs</title><link>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/logs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2020 10:40:03 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/logs/</guid><description>Centralized logging &amp;amp; log analytics in a busy, distributed environment Logs play a crucial role in any system, providing valuable insights into your application&amp;rsquo;s behavior, system activities, and the causes of errors. It is essential to efficiently monitor these logs to ensure your system is functioning as expected. In case something goes wrong, you need to quickly identify the issue, understand what happened, and take preventive measures to avoid its recurrence.</description></item><item><title>Ethereact</title><link>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/ethereact/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2019 10:44:56 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/ethereact/</guid><description>ETHEReact: Build a Full Stack Decentralized E-Commerce App, Deploy to Ethereum Virtual Machine &amp;amp; Interact using ReactJS TL;DR This article is not an in-depth explanation of Blockchain or a marketing pitch for Crypto.
Instead, this article is intended to guide developers and blockchain enthusiasts in building an end-to-end prototype on the blockchain. By the end of this article, you will have constructed a basic decentralized e-commerce platform.
Throughout the article, you will write two contracts in Solidity (one for the supplier and another for the customer), compile and migrate your contract to the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), create a simple ReactJS frontend, and connect your frontend to the EVM using web3.</description></item></channel></rss>
