&lt;p>Meh&amp;hellip; what&amp;rsquo;s with the name? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a combination of &amp;ldquo;tomato&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;tick&amp;rdquo; (as in a timer) 🤷 Dad joke? Maybe.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Every productivity tool promises to make you more efficient. Most fail. (At least, that&amp;rsquo;s my experience.) Why? Because they fundamentally misunderstand how human cognition works. They treat our brains like simple input-output machines: set a timer, get focused work. Reality is far more complex.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Toxic Paw-sitivity: How I Barked up the wrong Tree</title><link>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/toxic-positivity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2024 14:19:22 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/toxic-positivity/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-accidental-success-syndrome-time-spent-no-wasted-trying-to-course-correct-a-company-that-was-never-on-course-in-the-first-place">The Accidental Success Syndrome: Time spent (no, wasted): trying to course correct a company that was never on course in the first place&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Picture this: It&amp;rsquo;s some year in between 2015 &amp;amp; 2020, and a plucky startup called (hypothetical and made up, of course) DoggoTech launches a &amp;lsquo;product&amp;rsquo; that&amp;hellip; lets you swipe right on pictures of adoptable dogs. (again, hypothetical and made up domain/product type for pets). It&amp;rsquo;s basically similar to some really popular products out there, but focused on pets &amp;ndash; dogs particularly. Fast forward to 2023, and DoggoTech is somehow a million-dollar company, despite the fact that their app or product should I say, still crashes if you try to swipe (read: some sort of action) on a Chihuahua.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ikigai</title><link>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/ikigai/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 21:11:27 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/ikigai/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="being-cavalier-about-passion-or-ikigai">Being cavalier about &amp;lsquo;Passion&amp;rsquo; or Ikigai.&lt;/h1>

&lt;/li>

&lt;p>💥 &amp;ldquo;People throw around the &amp;lsquo;P&amp;rsquo; word much too casually, much too cavalierly. We are setting people up for failure. And, people are like OMG, i&amp;rsquo;m supposed to find this passion and it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be instant love and i&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be instantly good at it &amp;ndash; life does not work that way. My advise is &amp;ndash; scratch a lot of itches, pursue a lot of interests and knock on wood, (maybe) one or two over your lifetime of those will turn into passion or ikigai&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mutex vs Semaphore</title><link>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/mutex-vs-semaphore/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 18:36:22 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/mutex-vs-semaphore/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="mutex-vs-semaphore-the-lesser-of-two-evils">Mutex vs Semaphore: The Lesser of Two Evils&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Mutexes and semaphores are like siblings in the synchronization primitives family — one a stickler for rules (mutex), the other more lenient but equally capable of chaos when misused (semaphore). I&amp;rsquo;ll try to dive into this family drama with a sprinkle of snark, to explore their strengths, weaknesses.. And, both drive me nuts when misused.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A mutex, short for &amp;ldquo;mutual exclusion,&amp;rdquo; is like that one friend who insists on being the only one to use their fancy pen.

&lt;p>LinkedIn bios are&amp;hellip; well, seriously? Tough and wrong to generalize, but LinkedIn bios are seldom a joke. Having worked with quite a few over the last 16-17 years, some are absolutely terrible at tech, people skills, or most often both. But their LinkedIn profiles - oh my wow! On the contrary, those who are past the Dunning-Kruger curve have far less &amp;lsquo;shiny&amp;rsquo; LinkedIn bios, but these are people who can get things done. So, for all the headhunters/hiring managers, my 2c: it&amp;rsquo;s never vanilla; please look beyond profiles and background checks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Oh, Python is slow?</title><link>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/memory-in-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2024 12:19:45 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/memory-in-python/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sure, keep blaming the language like the rest of the herd — But if your code’s leaky and crawling, Spoiler: it’s you, not the language😏&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ah, another day, another developer blaming Python for their code&amp;rsquo;s sluggish performance. 🐌 Before you join the chorus of the uninformed, let&amp;rsquo;s embark on a journey through the labyrinthine world of Python&amp;rsquo;s memory management.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s no short of snarky, condescending tech articles out there, sometimes they are pure BS but often they are an attempt to paint the &amp;ldquo;picture&amp;rdquo; in black and white by some frustrated programmer.

&lt;p>There are things that engineers - especially software folk do well, we nail some really hard intangible problems on its head and boy, it feels good to build something ground up or cleanup a pile of mess. But, this group, almost holistically suck at one thing - that is estimation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Software engineers are notoriously poor estimators (well, its my blog so this is my view anyways). As an industry, we are not poor performers, although it may seem that way, because the prediction of performance is poor. There are many reasons why we set unreasonable expectations, and few will deny that estimating is a complex task. When performance doesn&amp;rsquo;t meet the estimate, there are two possible causes: poor performance or poor estimates. In the software world, we have ample evidence that our estimates stink, but virtually no evidence that people in &lt;em>general&lt;/em> don&amp;rsquo;t work hard enough or intelligently enough.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Database Is Sacred</title><link>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/database-is-sacred/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2023 20:07:09 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/database-is-sacred/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="database-is-sacred-an-engineers-testament">Database is Sacred: An &amp;ldquo;Engineer&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; Testament&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>What does the word &amp;lsquo;database&amp;rsquo; make you think of? It&amp;rsquo;s probably difficult to generalize, but I&amp;rsquo;m guessing a good chunk of you would think of a &amp;lsquo;relational&amp;rsquo; flavor. Well, there&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of &amp;lsquo;flavors&amp;rsquo; among databases today, and I feel like talking — or venting — about how often relational databases are used beneath their potential today&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My (not so distant) future self will probably negate this title😁, but for the purpose of this blog or the context in my head today, yes - relational databases are awesome. They are sturdy and efficient enough to do what you need them to do: store and manipulate data. Yes, I said manipulate.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>We Have a Problem</title><link>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/we-have-a-problem/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2022 17:40:27 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/we-have-a-problem/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-reality-of-imaginary-problems---in-the-context-of-software">The Reality of Imaginary Problems - In the context of Software&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Many factors lead to ineffective software development: from the tools used, to team communication, to the personal motivation of developers, the testing approach to the organisational leadership matrix. Among these, there&amp;rsquo;s a fundamental issue that often results in poorly conceived software: chasing perceived or, more often than not, non-existent problems, that take shape through the process to prove some kinda relevance by one or many involved directly or indirectly in the process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pipelines</title><link>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/pipelines/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 10:42:18 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/pipelines/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="serverless-data-pipelines-aws-glue-is-a-potential-future-poster-figure-maybe-not-just-yet">Serverless Data Pipelines: AWS Glue is a potential future poster figure; maybe not just yet!&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Data engineering plays a pivotal role in the success of organizations, especially those that are data-driven. It can make or break an organization&amp;rsquo;s growth. Data pipelines form the foundation of data engineering. However, the term &amp;ldquo;pipeline&amp;rdquo; has become somewhat clichéd in software engineering, as it can mean different things depending on the context and significance of the tasks involved.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Logs</title><link>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/logs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2020 10:40:03 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/logs/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="centralized-logging--log-analytics-in-a-busy-distributed-environment">Centralized logging &amp;amp; log analytics in a busy, distributed environment&lt;/h1>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Instead, this article is intended to guide developers and blockchain enthusiasts in building an end-to-end prototype on the blockchain. By the end of this article, you will have constructed a basic decentralized e-commerce platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout the article, you will write two contracts in Solidity (one for the supplier and another for the customer), compile and migrate your contract to the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), create a simple ReactJS frontend, and connect your frontend to the EVM using web3.js.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
