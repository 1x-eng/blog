# Being cavalier about 'Passion' or Ikigai.

Some golden nuggets from [Guy Kawasaki](https://guykawasaki.com/) in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppHNQaqu-dM&list=PLQ2kxsZgRIDP4tEnWYu_oF6ZWcqJFK8Bs) podcast:

- ðŸ’¥ "If you have a growth mindset in a growth mindset organisation, you'll do well. But, if you have a growth mindset in a fixed mindset organisation, you'll suck" 

- ðŸ’¥ "People throw around the 'P' word much too casually, much too cavalierly. We are setting people up for failure. And, people are like OMG, i'm supposed to find this passion and it's supposed to be instant love and i'm supposed to be instantly good at it -- life does not work that way. My advise is -- scratch a lot of itches, pursue a lot of interests and knock on wood, (maybe) one or two over your lifetime of those will turn into passion or ikigai"
