# ETHEReact: Build a Full Stack Decentralized E-Commerce App, Deploy to Ethereum Virtual Machine & Interact using ReactJS

> TL;DR This article is not an in-depth explanation of Blockchain or a marketing pitch for Crypto.

Instead, this article is intended to guide developers and blockchain enthusiasts in building an end-to-end prototype on the blockchain. By the end of this article, you will have constructed a basic decentralized e-commerce platform.

Throughout the article, you will write two contracts in Solidity (one for the supplier and another for the customer), compile and migrate your contract to the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), create a simple ReactJS frontend, and connect your frontend to the EVM using web3.js.
