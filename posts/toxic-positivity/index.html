(again, hypothetical and made up domain/product type for pets). It&rsquo;s basically similar to some really popular products out there, but focused on pets &ndash; dogs particularly. Fast forward to 2023, and DoggoTech is somehow a million-dollar company, despite the fact that their app or product should I say, still crashes if you try to swipe (read: some sort of action) on a Chihuahua.</p><p>Welcome to the world of accidental success in tech, where mediocrity isn&rsquo;t just toleratedâ€”it&rsquo;s rewarded with a corner office and &lt;some fancy car/ &rsquo;toy&rsquo; / whatever the owners of the company think is a &lsquo;prize&rsquo;></p><h2 id=the-birth-of-a-unicorn>The Birth of a &ldquo;Unicorn&rdquo;</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s rewind a bit. DoggoTech&rsquo;s founders, Brad and Chad (because of course those are their names), stumbled upon their idea during a hackathon fueled by Red Bull and dreams of disrupting&mldr; something. Anything, really.</p><p>Their pitch? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like Uber, but for dog adoption!&rdquo; Investors, dazzled by the mention of Uber and the cute puppy logo, threw money at them faster than you can say &ldquo;unsustainable business model.&rdquo; Of course, the investment was &lsquo;secured&rsquo; by the tantalizing lack of competition in this niche problem spaceâ€”a digital playground where only a select, privileged few could participate. After all, nothing says &ldquo;guaranteed returns&rdquo; quite like artificial scarcity in the world of pet tech.</p><h2 id=the-good-enough-paradox>The &ldquo;Good Enough&rdquo; Paradox</h2><p>As DoggoTech grew, so did its problems. The codebase resembled a digital Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster, held together by duct tape and prayers. But here&rsquo;s the kicker: it didn&rsquo;t matter. They were making money hand over fist.</p><p>Why? Because in the world of pet tech, the bar was so low it was practically a tripping hazard. As long as users could occasionally match with a Labradoodle without the app bursting into flames, it was considered a roaring success.</p><h2 id=the-product-driven-fallacy>The &ldquo;Product-Driven&rdquo; Fallacy</h2><p>Brad and Chad, not tech literate, decided it was time to be a &ldquo;product-driven&rdquo; company. What did that mean? ðŸ¤· Nobody knew, but it sounded good in press releases.</p><p>They learned about &lsquo;scale&rsquo; and hired a team of engineers, promising them the chance to work on helping the company achieve that scale by shifting left on &lsquo;quality&rsquo; and &lsquo;reliability&rsquo;. The reality? Anyone who suggested a change to the &lsquo;status quo&rsquo; was met with the response &ndash; &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ve always done it this way and it&rsquo;s led us to where we are today, so let&rsquo;s just do it this way&rdquo;. Challenge again, and &ldquo;oh, you are on PIP. Learn to work with our franken-codebase & importantly, just nod yes to &lsquo;product manager&rsquo;, else, we are happy to offer a &lsquo;kind&rsquo; severance&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=toxic-positivity-the-corporate-kool-aid>Toxic Positivity: The Corporate Kool-Aid</h2><p>As problems mounted, DoggoTech&rsquo;s leadership embraced a culture of toxic positivity that would make a motivational poster blush. Constructive criticism was met with cries of &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re changing the world, one swipe (read: some action) at a time!&rdquo;</p><p>In one particularly cringe-worthy &ldquo;let&rsquo;s-all-learn-how-doggotech-works&rdquo; workshop, the engineer they hired to &lsquo;fix&rsquo; and help &lsquo;scale&rsquo; suggested adopting tried-and-tested practices from established platforms. Chad&rsquo;s response was a masterclass in startup exceptionalism:</p><p>&ldquo;Established practices? We&rsquo;re not here to follow, we&rsquo;re here to disrupt! Our users don&rsquo;t want some boring old adoption process (read: a process that actually works and is used by millions across the globe). They want&mldr; uh&mldr; &lt;some BS here &ndash; which confirms that DoggoTech wants to assume the gadgets/devices users own and has built their entire product around that>&rdquo;</p><p>The &lsquo;challenger&rsquo; (aka the engineer hired to improve things) later found their performance review dripping with Chad&rsquo;s special brand of toxic positivity. It praised their &ldquo;undeniable technical skills&rdquo; but criticized their &ldquo;lack of team spirit&rdquo; and &ldquo;antagonistic attitude towards our visionary product teams.&rdquo; The review concluded with a gem of doublespeak:</p><p>&ldquo;While we appreciate your attempts to &lsquo;improve&rsquo; our battle-tested architecture, your constant challenges to our way of working show a fundamental misalignment with DoggoTech&rsquo;s culture of innovation through chaos. We believe in your potential to grow, which is why we&rsquo;re offering you the opportunity to participate in our Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). Should you feel this growth opportunity doesn&rsquo;t align with your career goals, we&rsquo;re more than happy to discuss a generous severance package. Remember, at DoggoTech, every ending is just a new beginning!&rdquo;</p><p>Translation: &ldquo;We hired you to fix our mess, but how dare you try to actually fix our mess? Here&rsquo;s a PIP for doing your job. Don&rsquo;t like it? There&rsquo;s the door, but we&rsquo;ll call it a &lsquo;career transition opportunity&rsquo; because we&rsquo;re all about that positive spin. Welcome to DoggoTech, where gaslighting is an art form and cognitive dissonance is a job requirement!&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-illusion-of-innovation>The Illusion of Innovation</h2><p>Innovation at DoggoTech meant adding a &ldquo;Cat Mode&rdquo; that just turned the app upside down. It was heralded as revolutionary, despite being completely useless and mildly nauseating.</p><p>Their product roadmap was less of a strategic plan and more of a fever dream scribbled on a napkin during a boozy lunch. Features weren&rsquo;t added because they solved problems, but because Brad saw them in a Black Mirror episode and thought, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-bitter-taste-of-success>The Bitter Taste of Success</h2><p>As I sit here, nursing my overpriced latte and trying to suppress the PTSD from my stint at DoggoTech (yes, I was there, and no, it&rsquo;s not worthy enough to make it to my CV or LinkedIn profile, so it&rsquo;ll remain a secret), I can&rsquo;t help but laugh at the circus I escaped from.</p><p>Disclaimer: Any resemblance to actual tech companies, living or dead, is purely coincidental. Especially the ones on my resume. Really.</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
