Stumbled upon <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nondv/>Dimitry&rsquo;s</a> take - <a href=https://nondv.wtf/blog/posts/microservices-arent-the-problem-incompetent-people-are.html>incompetent people are the problem</a>, while we are strangers, his words struck a chord.</p><p>I resonate with these bits from <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nondv/>Dimitry&rsquo;s</a> article & PS: all views are my own.</p><ul><li><p>The smart-ass complex</p><ul><li>Knowing how to code or open a terminal and use git grep doesn‚Äôt make you smart nor educated.</li><li>Not being smart is totally fine. We just need to avoid being stupid. And we need to be humble and not let our egos blind us.</li><li>If we recognise we aren‚Äôt smart, we can start going back to basics by keeping it simple.</li><li>If we aren‚Äôt smart enough to predict future problems, we shouldn‚Äôt even try. Instead, let‚Äôs solve the problems at hand as they come and do our best at keeping things clean and flexible</li></ul></li><li><p>Not giving a shit</p><ul><li>Having a ‚Äúno fucks given‚Äù culture is a disease. It poisons everything around it.</li><li>At some point everyone stops trying to improve things. They simply go with the flow.</li><li>Not owning stuff creates bigger snowballs. People don‚Äôt care and sometimes people are unable to confirm crappy code isn‚Äôt shitty for a reason.</li></ul></li><li><p>Incompetence</p><ul><li>If someone‚Äôs used hammers and nails all their life and you give them screws and a screwdriver, they‚Äôll simply say ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs a pretty crappy hammer but the job is a job‚Äù and proceed to smashing the screw into the wood with the handle. If you want them to use it properly, invest in their education or at least handhold them until proficient. Do people do that? Less often than one would expect. And don‚Äôt forget teams where the tech leads have no idea what they‚Äôre doing either.</li><li>Incompetent people hire other incompetent people who then get involved in hiring. It‚Äôs exponential.</li><li>If you don‚Äôt care about the company, care about yourself. And speak up</li><li>Don‚Äôt worry about the company‚Äôs success if your skin is not in the game. Think about your own comfort. What could we change so you felt a bit better? Identify those problems and speak up</li></ul></li></ul><p>He also talks about what is his version of &ldquo;competence&rdquo;, that part is nice too.. mostly text book. Things that we as professional programmers should live and breath. Do we? Well, that&rsquo;s an article for another day. Ciao for now üëã</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
