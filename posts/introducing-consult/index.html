(i.e. a database &rsquo;expert&rsquo;, backend &rsquo;expert&rsquo;, an infra &rsquo;expert&rsquo;, etc.). they analyze the problem independently, then each agent reviews each other agent&rsquo;s output. they vote on each other&rsquo;s work: APPROVE, CONCERNS, or OBJECT. if they don&rsquo;t hit the consensus threshold, they iterate with the feedback incorporated. finally, a synthesis &lsquo;agent&rsquo; merges everything into one recommendation (without missing any trade-offs or objections, ensuring they are duly passed back to the user to consider)</p><p>the interesting part isn&rsquo;t any individual agent&rsquo;s output. it&rsquo;s what happens when they collide. say you ask about migrating a high-traffic table with dozens of foreign keys. the &ldquo;database expert&rdquo; (read: llm with a dba-flavored system prompt) proposes a dual-write pattern. the &ldquo;backend expert&rdquo; reviews it and flags that coordinating 47 fk updates under load needs application-level orchestration. the &ldquo;infra expert&rdquo; points out the wal replication lag from a multi-hour backfill. are they always right? nope - gotta take llms with a grain of salt. but they&rsquo;re each seeing different parts of the elephant, and that&rsquo;s the point.</p><p>single-agent responses smooth over these tensions. multiple agents with cross-review surface them.</p><h2 id=what-this-doesnt-do>what this doesn&rsquo;t do</h2><p>it doesn&rsquo;t replace knowing your domain. if you can&rsquo;t evaluate whether the agents&rsquo; reasoning is sound, you&rsquo;re just adding latency to bad decisions.</p><p>it&rsquo;s not fast. 45-150 seconds, depending on the number of agents and iterations. that&rsquo;s n independent analyses plus n*(n-1) pairwise reviews plus synthesis. the latency is the feature - you&rsquo;re trading speed for coverage. and, that&rsquo;s the point of this tool.</p><p>it doesn&rsquo;t give you &ldquo;the answer.&rdquo; it gives you a synthesis with the reasoning chains visible. you still have to read them and decide if they make sense.</p><h2 id=when-its-worth-the-overhead>when it&rsquo;s worth the overhead</h2><p>the decision framework i use: is the cost of getting this wrong higher than the cost of spending 2 minutes and 5-10x the tokens?</p><p>worth it:</p><ul><li>schema migrations you can&rsquo;t easily roll back</li><li>auth/security decisions with compliance implications</li><li>architectural choices that&rsquo;ll be expensive to change in 6 months</li><li>anything where multiple domains intersect and you don&rsquo;t have easy access to experts in all of them</li></ul><p>not worth it:</p><ul><li>syntax questions</li><li>standard patterns that are well-documented</li><li>anything you can undo in an afternoon</li></ul><h2 id=an-example>an example</h2><p>was designing active-passive failover for a payments service across two regions. standard setup - async replication to the standby, dns failover with health checks, the usual. i&rsquo;d thought through the rpo/rto numbers, tested the failover runbook, felt good about it.</p><p>ran it through consult. the &ldquo;infra expert&rdquo; approved the failover mechanics. the &ldquo;database expert&rdquo; asked about in-flight transactions during the replication lag window - specifically, what happens to a payment that commits in the primary 400ms before the primary dies, but hasn&rsquo;t replicated yet? the &ldquo;backend expert&rdquo; pointed out that our idempotency keys were scoped to the primary&rsquo;s request-id generator. as in, after failover, a retry from a client could generate a &ldquo;new&rdquo; idempotency key on the standby and double-process a payment that actually succeeded on the now-dead primary.</p><p>that last one is subtle. it&rsquo;s not about the failover itself - it&rsquo;s about the interaction between our idempotency implementation and the failover semantics. i&rsquo;d tested failover. i&rsquo;d tested idempotency. i hadn&rsquo;t tested them together under a split-brain-adjacent scenario.</p><p>that&rsquo;s the kind of thing a single-perspective review misses. the infra person validates infra. the backend person validates backend. nobody&rsquo;s asking &ldquo;what happens when these two correct implementations interact during a failure mode?&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-cost>the cost</h2><ul><li>45-150 seconds latency (vs ~5 seconds for a single call)</li><li>5-10x token usage</li><li>another cli tool to learn</li></ul><p>what you get back is structured friction before you commit to something. whether that&rsquo;s worth it depends on how expensive the mistake would be.</p><h2 id=try-it>try it</h2><p>consult is a cli tool (pro users get a <code>tui</code> interface). <code>pip install getconsult</code> <a href=https://pypi.org/project/getconsult/>PyPi</a>. and, consult is a <code>byok</code> model. as in, you bring your own api keys (anthropic, openai, or google), pay the providers directly. i don&rsquo;t see your questions, interactions, attachments or store your data. its all happening on your local.</p><p>free tier gets you 2 experts, 3 queries/day. pro is $9/month for more experts, iterations, and features.</p><p><a href=https://getconsult.sysapp.dev>getconsult.sysapp.dev</a></p><p>if you try it and it doesn&rsquo;t help, i&rsquo;d like to know why: <a href=https://github.com/1x-eng/consult-issues/issues>issueTracker</a></p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
