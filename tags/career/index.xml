work this year, i chose to accept the role of principal engineer at Qoria.
first, a nod to the roads not taken. big thanks to montu and genomical for the lucrative offers. i hope the bridge isn&amp;rsquo;t burnt, but i couldn&amp;rsquo;t say no to qoria this time. it was a bet on the mission, and a chance to join forces with Jen Marfell again.</description></item><item><title>on staff+ roles</title><link>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/staff-plus-is-all-about-friction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:36:28 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://1x-eng.github.io/blog/posts/staff-plus-is-all-about-friction/</guid><description>its been about six years since i stepped onto the staff+ treadmill.
in the beginning, the title feels like a linear progression. you assume it&amp;rsquo;s simply about more leverage - as in, to be solving harder distributed systems problems, or optimizing deeper into the kernel, or architecting for the next order of magnitude yada yada&amp;hellip; and sure, that&amp;rsquo;s the table stakes. but over time, the shine wears off. you realize that while technical depth bought you the ticket, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t play the game.</description></item></channel></rss>
